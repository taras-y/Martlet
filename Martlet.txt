    Martlet

Martlet above
Spring fields and hills
Wishing us cheers
Winter cold ends

Serinus birds
Martlet's best friends
Show their homes
Welcoming guests

Sheeps rolling down
Valleys and hills
Got many lambs
Martlet believes

You have best goods
Ready for sales
You'll get for sure
Great money wealth

Money sometimes
Doesn't make sense
Look at your wife
She's very nice

Martlet above
Spring fields and hills
Wishing us cheers
Winter cold ends
